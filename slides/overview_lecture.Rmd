# The philosophy of WORCS

- YES to open
- YES to reproducible
- YES to best practices

# Version control

#### Why do you need version control?

.pull-left[

- It will help you manage ~~your code~~ most of your files (it is like track changes on steroids: it applies to all files in a folder).

- It allows you to trace back your steps: if something breaks, you can figure out what happened.

- NO MORE thesis_final_final_SERIOUSLYFINAL.Rmd

even better:
- a good version control system allows you to collaborate and share!

- a good version control system facilitates experimentation!

### What is git?
- Distributed Version Control system written by Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame)

- Allows you to log updates, branch your work (so you can experiment without losing the original!), and keep all backups, while efficiently using your storage

- Gives user a lot of control on what to track, and adds a narrative to changes ('commit comments')

- Current standard for code

- Open Source software written for the command line...

- ... but many GUI-clients exist nowadays, and most coding IDEs have built-in git.]

# Version control

# How does git work

1. Add the changed file(s) to the staging area, and commit the changes:
```bash
git add src/filename.py anotherfile.txt
git add config/configfile.json
git commit -m "My commit message"
```
OR

2. commit files directly, without staging:
```bash
git commit src/filename.py anotherfile.txt -m "My commit message"
```

NB: don't forget your commit message (try what happens if you do!).

# Enjoy, and git responsibly!

- Commits should be atomic: comprehensive 'units' of changes.
  - **DO**: edit/add an .svg and add it to your .Rmd presentation in the same commit
  - **DON'T**: edit for a full day and put this in a single commit (or worse: forget to...)

- Commits should have informative messages so you (and others) can trace your steps

  ![git_commit](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png)

- Track most files; .gitignore those files you don't.

- Explore new ideas with branches, keep a stable version on `master`
